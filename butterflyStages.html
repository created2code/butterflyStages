                <h1>THE EGG</h1>
                <p>Eggs are laid safely on plants by an adult female butterfly. They are attached to a leaf using an adhesive-like substance that glues the egg to the plant leaf. These plants will then become the food for the hatching caterpillars.</p>

                <h1>THE CATEPILLAR</h1>
                <p>The next stage is the larva. This is also called a caterpillar. The job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat. As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and sheds it about 4 or 5 times.</p>

                <h1>THE CHRYSALIS</h1>
                <p>When the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating, it becomes a pupa. The pupa of butterflies is also called a chrysalis. Special cells that were present in the larva are now growing rapidly. They will become the legs, wings, eyes and other parts of the adult butterfly.</p>

                <h1>THE BUTTERFLY</h1>
                <p>Once the caterpillar has done all of its forming and changing inside the pupa, a butterfly will emerge. It will pump blood into its wings in order to get them to fly. Most adult butterflies live only one or two weeks, but some species hibernate during the winter and may live several months. Adult butterflies are constantly on the look out to reproduce and when a female lays their eggs on some leaves, the butterfly life cycle will start all over.</p>
